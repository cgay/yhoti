Yhoti -- Your Home on the Internet
**********************************

*This website is (for now) a pitch for a new social media platform.  I know, you hear
"social media" and you run screaming in the opposite direction!  I will be brief....*

Elevator Pitch (short version)
==============================

Facebook, but

* Restricted to people you invite (family, friends, or open to the world if you want)
* You own all the data.
* No algorithm pushing content on you.
* No ads.
* Interconnected with other Yhotis.

That's it. That's the pitch. I don't want to invoke "Facebook" because that puts a
specific idea in your head, but it's a quick way to get the basic idea across.

Still reading?...

Elevator Pitch (longer version)
===============================

The Facebook analogy is a lie.  Yhoti **is** a place where you can chat in with your
friends and post updates about your cats, but **you** are in the driver seat rather than
Facebook's algorithm **or** your friends.

* Yhoti is **active** -- you decide which friends' Yhotis to check out rather than
  passively consuming a stream of your friends' and acquaintences' responses to arbitrary
  content that was pushed to **them** by an algorithm.

* Yhoti is **thoughtful** -- Yhoti moves at a slower pace because you're not constantly
  consuming a stream of posts curated by an algorithm. Posting content is like writing a
  blog or a microblog. People can comment on your entries and you can curate those
  comments. Real-time chat happens on a different page, separating real-time interactions
  from more thoughtful content.

* Yhoti is **flexible** -- Completely control your own Yhoti, share one with your family,
  or run a public Yhoti for thousands of people. Turn major features on/off with ease.
  It's up to you!

* Yhoti is **you in control** -- You control where your data is stored and how it is
  backed up. You decide who can or can't contribute, from fully public to only
  allow-listed individuals. You can remove unwanted contributions without having to beg a
  social media giant to do it for you.  It's your house.

* Yhoti **has no algorithm** -- Have I mentioned there's no algorithm pushing unwanted
  content into your "stream"?  There is no stream, just a place for you to have a
  presence on the web and perhaps a place from which to start your daily internet
  journey. *ooooooooohhhhhmmm*

* Yhoti is **not a competition** -- It's not about trying to get the most friends or the
  most "likes" for your content, it's about having a place to express yourself. Yes,
  people can still "like" your content (free dopamine!), but because there is no
  algorithm pushing this information to all your friends it's not a competition.

* Yhoti is **easy to run** -- It is absolutely trivial to get up and running. Choose from
  a menu of features to enable.  By default anyone can view content but must have an
  account to contribute, and you must approve all accounts.  Friends can login with their
  Facebook or Google account or create a local account.

* Yhoti is **interconnected** (but not monolithic) -- Each Yhoti instance automatically
  provides links to other referenced or explicitly recommended Yhotis.  These references
  can be organized by topic and show recent activity on the other Yhotis.

* Yhoti is **open source and free** -- All the code can be improved or audited by anyone 

Yhoti returns us to the early promise of the Internet, where **your eyeballs are not the
product, making billionaires ever richer through ads** but instead where you can express
yourself freely and creatively! The whole point of the Web is that you don't need to put
your content into one centralized system like Facebook or Twitter because anyone can make
their own site.

**Centralized social media isn't working**; it's toxic because "the algorithm" pushes the
content that generates the most heat.  At the same time, we need a way to connect with
people on the internet. Facebook, Twitter, Bluesky, et al are convenient, but if it's
easy enough to run a Yhoti for yourself, your town, your business, or your gaming
buddies, maybe we can escape the toxic aspects of centralized social media.

It would be great if Big Social disappeared completely, but that isn't a realistic goal.
The idea is to **develop an alternative social media ecosystem** over time that is rich
enough that people won't feel like Big Social is the only way to go.

**What about Mastodon?** Mastodon was a step in the right direction: Distributed Twitter
without the algorithm or ads.  But Mastodon depends on the "stream" metaphor, which is
fundamentally not the way I, at least, want to interact with people on the Internet.  It
discourages self-directed reading, encourages trivial interactions, and makes it hard to
find content later.  You can still do all of those things on Yhoti if you want, it will
just be presented in a way that means **you decide** when to do it.

**What about the blogosphere?** The blogosphere is great!  Yhoti is an attempt to expand
the blogosphere (let's call it the Yhotiverse :) and make it a more attractive
alternative to Big Social by making it trivial to run a more fully-featured site (blog,
photo albums, chat, etc.) with one simple tool under your full control.
